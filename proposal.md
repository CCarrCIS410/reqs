# Project Proposal
## Description
Our website will be a support ticketing system that can be used for a variety of software, projects and organizations. While the project may expand in the future, there will be two basic types of users of the website: administrators and customers. Customers will be able to submit issues and feature requests for software and other projects without needing to create an account. Instead, they will verify which software/project/organization they are submitting a ticket for via a unique URL or some other method. Administrators will be able to login and moderate tickets, assigning tags, priorities, and support staff to them.

## Functionality
- Customer: Submit a ticket for a problem encountered with the software, project, or organization.
- Customer: Submit a feature request for the software, project, or organization.
- Customer: Submit a screenshot to help administrators replicate an issue.
- Administrator: Assign tickets to other administrators on the same software, project, or organization team.
- Administrator: Assign tickets a priority (High, Medium, Low).
- Administrator: Assign tickets a custom tag (i.e. css, js, docs, examples, etc.).
- Administrator: Assign and track tickets by status (Open, In Progress, Resolved, etc.).

## Business Rules
_A preliminary list of the rules that will govern your application._

## Assumptions
